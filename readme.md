<p>
    <strong>rs-quant</strong> is a Rust library designed for quantitative finance enthusiast. It provides a robust set of models,
    formulas, and tools to perform financial analysis for multiple financials instruments.
</p>
<p>
    This repo will be developed to be used in an integrated and optimized manner with the <strong>portfolio-rs</strong> crate (also
    currently in development) and <strong>securities-master</strong> project (database managed using python, currently in development).
</p>
<p>
    rs-quant is currently in its early stages of development. It will be constantly changing, and may not be finished. Who
    knows...
