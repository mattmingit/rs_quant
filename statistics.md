Absolutely! Using both `ndarray` + `ndarray-stats` and `statrs` together is a **great idea** and a very common approach in quantitative finance and scientific computing. Each library excels in its own domain, and combining them allows you to leverage their strengths without compromising on functionality or performance.

Hereâ€™s how you can effectively use both libraries in your quantitative finance library:


### **`ndarray` + `ndarray-stats`**
#### **Use Cases**:
1. **Data Handling**:
   - Store and manipulate time series data, matrices, and multi-dimensional arrays.
   - Perform slicing, broadcasting, and other array operations efficiently.

2. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Compute mean, variance, standard deviation, correlation, covariance, quantiles, etc.
   - Analyze financial data (e.g., stock returns, portfolio performance).

3. **Linear Algebra**:
   - Use `ndarray` for matrix operations, decompositions, and other linear algebra tasks.
   - Perform PCA, portfolio optimization, or other matrix-based computations.

4. **Performance**:
   - Handle large datasets and perform parallel computations (e.g., with `rayon`).

### **`statrs`**
#### **Use Cases**:
1. **Probability Distributions**:
   - Model financial data using distributions like normal, log-normal, binomial, Poisson, etc.
   - Compute PDF, CDF, quantiles, and random sampling.

2. **Statistical Functions**:
   - Perform hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests, chi-square tests).
   - Use advanced statistical functions not available in `ndarray-stats`.

3. **Theoretical Statistics**:
   - Implement statistical models and algorithms for quantitative finance (e.g., VaR, Monte Carlo simulations).

### **How to Combine Them**:
1. **Data Flow**:
   - Use `ndarray` to store and preprocess your data (e.g., stock prices, returns).
   - Pass the processed data to `statrs` for probability distribution fitting or statistical tests.

2. **Example Workflow**:
   - Load financial data into an `ndarray::Array2` (2D array).
   - Compute descriptive statistics (mean, variance, etc.) using `ndarray-stats`.
   - Fit a probability distribution (e.g., normal distribution) to the data using `statrs`.
   - Perform random sampling or statistical tests using `statrs`.

3. **Code Example**:
   ```rust
   use ndarray::{array, Array1};
   use ndarray_stats::QuantileExt;
   use statrs::distribution::{Normal, ContinuousCDF};

   fn main() {
       // Example: Analyzing stock returns
       let returns: Array1<f64> = array![-0.02, 0.03, 0.01, -0.01, 0.02];

       // Descriptive statistics using ndarray-stats
       let mean = returns.mean().unwrap();
       let max_return = returns.max().unwrap();

       println!("Mean return: {}", mean);
       println!("Max return: {}", max_return);

       // Probability distribution using statrs
       let normal_dist = Normal::new(0.0, 1.0).unwrap();
       let probability = normal_dist.cdf(0.5); // P(X <= 0.5)

       println!("Probability (X <= 0.5): {}", probability);
   }
   ```

4. **Dependencies**:
   Add both libraries to your `Cargo.toml`:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   ndarray = "0.15"
   ndarray-stats = "0.5"
   statrs = "0.16"
   ```

### **Advantages of Combining Both**:
1. **Modularity**:
   - Each library handles a specific aspect of your computations, making your code cleaner and more maintainable.

2. **Performance**:
   - `ndarray` is optimized for numerical computations, while `statrs` is lightweight and focused on statistics.

3. **Flexibility**:
   - You can easily extend your library with additional functionality (e.g., `rand_distr` for random sampling, `nalgebra` for advanced linear algebra).

4. **Comprehensive Coverage**:
   - You get the best of both worlds: efficient data handling and advanced statistical functions.

### **When to Avoid Combining**:
- If your library has very minimal statistical needs, you might choose just one to keep dependencies light.
- If youâ€™re working in a constrained environment (e.g., embedded systems), you might prefer a single library to reduce binary size.

---

### **Conclusion**:
Using **`ndarray` + `ndarray-stats`** for data handling, descriptive statistics, and linear algebra, and **`statrs`** for probability distributions and advanced statistical functions is a **powerful combination**. This approach is well-suited for building a robust and efficient quantitative finance library in Rust. Go for it! ðŸš€
